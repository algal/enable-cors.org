# Enable CORS advocacy and support site

This is the source code and input-collection place for [enable-cors.org](http://enable-cors.org). Ask [Monsur](https://github.com/monsur) or [Michael](https://github.com/mhausenblas) if you have any questions.

## Feedback

If you have a new recipe for CORS deployment, or a library enabling CORS, or maybe want to report a new site or service that supports CORS, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/mhausenblas/enable-cors.org/issues) and we'll take it from there.

## Build

* The project page lives in the [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/mhausenblas/enable-cors.org/tree/gh-pages); read the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles) if you're unsure how it works
* The raw resulting project page can be found at [http://mhausenblas.info/enable-cors.org/](mhausenblas.info/enable-cors.org/)
* Once we're ready to switch over to the new design, we'll follow the steps outline in ['Setting up a custom domain with Pages'](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages)
